<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I have had a crazy life much of it thanks to my weird but facinating lifestyle as I was born in Karachi, Pakistan, but shifted to South Africa at just a few months old. </p>I have always loved nerdy and techy hobbies which include computer hardware, gaming, anime, chess (which I am terrible at) and reading. My favourite books so far<br/> are the Mistborn series and Stormlight Archieve series both by Brandon Sanderson and my favourite anime is Attack on Titan.</p>
